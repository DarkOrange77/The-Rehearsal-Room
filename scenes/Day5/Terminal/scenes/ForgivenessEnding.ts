    narration: `
The curtain has fallen. But not with applause.  
Just the hush of something finally exhaling.

Eleanor stands alone in the wings, the weight of stage makeup smudged beneath her eyes, her costume threadbare at the seams. The stage behind her is dim now—empty chairs, overturned props, a cracked spotlight that still twitches every few seconds like a dying firefly.

She doesn’t look at the audience anymore.  
She looks inward.

A door creaks behind her. Not grand. Not carved. Just a plain wooden one, as if plucked from a real home and dropped here like a mistake.

She hesitates.  
Then she opens it.

🎼  
Scene: Mirror Room (Real One)  
Inside is a narrow dressing room.  
No velvet.  
No theatrical fog.  
Just harsh white light. A single chair. And a mirror.

No trick.  
No delay.  
No alternate reflection.  
It’s her.  
Hair mussed. Skin pale. Eyes—hers. For once.

And yet...  
She doesn’t sit. Not yet.  
Because there’s one last thing to do.

A note lies on the vanity. Plain paper. Folded twice. Written in pen, not ink.  
It’s her handwriting.

“Thank you for letting me stop.”

She finally sits.  
Not to perform.  
But to rest.

She places the note down, carefully. Then wipes the makeup from her cheeks. The redness fades. The sharpness of the stage contour dulls. She becomes… softer. Warmer.  
Real.
