There’s no music now. Just a low, buzzing hum, like an amp left on too long.

Eleanor stands at center stage — but she’s wrong. Her smile loops between expressions. Her mouth twitches. She opens it to speak… and a sound cue from Day 1 plays instead.

In the rafters, the Clown watches. Head tilted. Silent. Until he begins to slow clap.

CLOWN:  
Bravo. Really.  
You found the funny ending.  
You poked the puppet until she cried.  
You broke the mirror just to count the shards.

The lights go out, one by one — not dramatically. Just... awkwardly, like someone forgot how to end a scene.

A final message types itself slowly, letter by letter:

THE REHEARSAL ROOM HAS ENCOUNTERED A FATAL ERROR.  
TRYING TO FIND A SCRIPT THAT STILL MAKES SENSE...  
...  
NO SCRIPT FOUND.  
“YOU GOT YOUR LAUGH. NOW GET OFF THE STAGE.”
